New: There is a new variant of MatrixFree::cell_loop() which takes two
std::function objects with ranges on the locally owned degrees of freedom, one
with work to be scheduled before the cell operation first touches some
unknowns, and one after the cell operation last touches them. The goal of
these functions is to bring vector operations close to the time when the
vector entries are accessed by the cell operation which increases the cache
hit rate of modern processors (temporal locality).
